# Verifying Volunteer Entries to the NYC Trees Census

Using NYC Open Datas's [2015 Street Tree Census Data Set](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2015-Street-Tree-Census-Tree-Data/pi5s-9p35) (click **Export** to download a non-geospatial version of the dataset), I perform exploratory data analysis and feature engineering to find the significance of certain variables on the health of NYC street trees. I then create a classification model in the hopes of checking the likelihood of the veracity of the health status imputed by volunteers. Ultimately, my goal is to determine which features are most important to help my model, which information may be helpful for future censuses, and finally, creating a list of trees imputed by volunteers for which the health status does not match that of my model.
